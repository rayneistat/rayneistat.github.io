					<p>Our manufacturing team discovered that some parts were getting damaged during delivery. I was tasked with identifying the root cause of this breakage, as well as redesigning the part, testing it, and deploying it as an official change. During development, I performed several drop tests to determine the magnitude of the problem, and developed a molding process using a 2-part, 5-minute silicone kit. The result was an improved part that did not break during transit.</p>
					<p>First Picture: With some O-ring stock, I made a Works-Like model of my improved retainer</p>
					<p>Second Picture: A first-pass design of the retainer</p>
					<p>Third Pictrue: After molding the first design, this is an iteration</p>
					<p>Fourth Picture: The final SolidWorks model of the improved retainer</p>
					<p>Fifth Picture: The improved and fabricated retainer with its pull-tabs snipped off</p>
					<p>Sixth Picture: An example of the mold that I created with SolidWorks, printed out and filled with 2-part Silicone to fabricate the retainer iterations</p>
