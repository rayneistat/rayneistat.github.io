              <p>As a final project for a mechanical design course, I worked with a group of four others to create a robot, situated on a vertical 4"x4" post, meant to transport a 3-inch figure from a bottom platform to a top platform, a vertical distance of about 4 feet. The entire class had to make a machine that fit into a 12"x12"x12" box before and after operation. Our machine worked by rappelling a laser-cut wooden carriage down the post from an aluminum gearbox (it used 2 chains, we named our machine "2Chainz") attached to a 14-lb counterweight on the other side. We used the counterweight to reduce the amount of energy required to operate our design.</p>
              <p>At the end of the term, our professor held a competition to see whose design was the most energy-efficient while completing the figure-transport task. Our machine was the winner. To the right: a semi-isometric view of our machine on a dummy post. Our gripping mechanism was designed to move outwards with a rack-and-pinion mechanism, and to clamp down on the figure using four-bar linkage. The basket is meant to wrangle the wire. To the diagonal: A side profile of our machine, displaying the reeling mechanism used to rappel the carriage down the post. The carriage is was maintained to be lightweight because it used the weight of the gripping arm to stay square to the rest of the machine. To the bottom: My project group with our machine. I am to the right of the machine on the table. Apologies for not making the machine very visible, but this was an awesome group to work with and I thought I'd highlight the fact that we worked well together and made a successful product.</p>
